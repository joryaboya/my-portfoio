## __About__ ## 



This website was built with the intention of displaying my abilities as a developer in terms of design and skills. It also includes some context with regard to who I am as a person which is also expressed through the design. 

The site itself is entirely presented on one page, with it divided into five sections as shown by the site map below. Key features include the navigation bar which is on the left hand side of the page, and the large view covering images that signify each section of the website.
